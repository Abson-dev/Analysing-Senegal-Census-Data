# Analysing-Senegal-Census-Data
 
Preparation of data for the two censuses:

- Data coding in SPSS files (three files per year)
- Identical coding of DR shapefiles

Calculation of relevant indicators:

-	Calculation of indices on household component variables (age of heads of household, by gender between the two censuses), 
-	Multivariate calculation for poverty indices (household assets, level of education, access to services (amenities, water, etc.))
-	Calculation of population dynamics index (demographic growth at DR level)
Spatial and statistical joins
-	Joining indicators calculated in SPSS files with shapefile files

Data analysis on R:

-	Develop R scripts with QGIS for spatial analysis (based on the method used by Kyle Walker of US Census. Documentation available [here](https://walker-data.com/ ) but also other relevant methods (spatial regression, spatial autocorrelation, LISA, GWR)
-	Output the results as a map with graphical options (Histogram) according to certain comparison models, as in the example below
